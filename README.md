# :robot: Discord Bot Boi

My very first [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) program hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and written with the [Discordjs](https://discord.js.org/#/) module.

~~What's new?~~

It was written for a gag gift for my friend and now I've let it get out of hand... 

However here are some actually cool features if you want to base our bot on mine as well!

- Constantly up to date Commands list through fs reader
- Dynamic commands system
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)-less!
- Moderation and message management
- Usage of Discord objects through the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
- As well as beginner-friendly practice of splicing and other functions
